Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in `Double Honours Math + CS` at McGill University.  <br>
My current courses at McGill includes: Applied Machine Learning, Honours Analysis 1, Algebra 1, Intro to Computer Systems

I am genuinely passionate with the broad field of <b> Artifical Intelligence </b> and <b> Robotics </b> 

In my spare time(that is, I'm not grinding on assignments) I enjoy playing badminton, taking a swim, traveling and cooking!
<br>
Alsoo, grabbing a book a reading the afternoon away also sounds pretty good too! => Feel free to check out my [Reading List Page](/al-folio/publications/)

I am changing my biography! I am changing the front end!


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
